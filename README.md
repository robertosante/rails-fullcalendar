# Rails::Fullcalendar
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-fullcalendar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails-fullcalendar

## Usage

```
//= require moment
//= require fullcalendar
```
(turbolinks)
Then in you application.js file add the following:

```
function eventCalendar() {
  return $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
    header: {
        left: 'prev,next today myCustomButton',
        center: 'title',
        right: 'month,agendaWeek,agendaDay'
    }
  });
};
$(document).on('turbolinks:load', eventCalendar);
```

If you have disabled turbolinks just add to application.js:

```
$('#calendar').fullCalendar({});
```
